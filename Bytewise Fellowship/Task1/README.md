Task 1 was given to us to recap the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

HTML, simply builds the structure of our webpage like what is going to come after the heading, or which text will open a new tab.

CSS is a styling language that gives an enhanced presentation of our webpage. Simply speaking, it gives colors and an overall new wardrobe for it.

JavaScript makes our webpage more interactive and fun!!
